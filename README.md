### Hi there 👋, I'm İstemihan!

I am an independent **Solo Game Developer** forging immersive experiences with a foundation built on professional software engineering and over a decade of design expertise.

My journey is defined by a 20-year passion for video game history and mechanics. After a successful career in **Full-Stack Development** and **UI/UX Design** (working with companies like *Albinasoft* and *Blueberry Consultants*), I made a radical pivot in **late 2025**.

I have returned to my roots in **C#**—a language I first worked with in 2015—to dedicate my full professional capacity to Game Development.

### 🧬 The "Solo Dev" Advantage

I don't just write scripts; I architect complete products. My background allows me to handle the entire pipeline:

* **Engineering Architecture:** Years of experience with **TypeScript** & **React** at an enterprise level taught me strict typing, modular component design, and state management—principles I now strictly apply to Unity.
* **UI/UX Mastery:** With **12+ years** of freelance design experience and professional usage of **Figma**, I ensure my games have intuitive, pixel-perfect interfaces, bypassing the common "programmer art" bottleneck.
* **Social Responsibility:** My volunteering history (AFAD, AHBAP) has trained me in crisis management and disciplined teamwork, ensuring I ship resilient code even under pressure.
